### Standing on the shoulders of :us:

A special thanks to the teams at [GSA](https://github.com/GSA/)/[18F](https://github.com/18F/) for their open and transparent model, which benefits citizens, government, and technology.

This application is optimized for deployment on 18F's [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) static site hosting service.

We use the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), a set of reusable, high quality components for modern websites. [Many other U.S. government websites use the System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/docs/WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md).

### Developing locally

If you're using this repository to run the site locally, follow these instructions.

Dependencies:

-   **Node 6+** to install USWDS and dependencies
-   **Ruby** and **bundler** to install / run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

#### First-time setup

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  `npm install` to install the USWDS, and Gulp dependencies.
3.  `npm install -g gulp` to let you use the `gulp` CLI directly.
4.  `bundle install` to install Jekyll.

#### Running the app

If you'll be editing the Sass/CSS:

-   `gulp watch`

To run the app:

-   `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
